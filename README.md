# sts-protemplate
Yeoman generator for starting up new Slay the Spire mods

## How to use

1. Install [yeoman](https://yeoman.io/learning/)
2. Run `npm install -g generator-sts-protemplate`
3. Navigate to your local git repo
4. Run `yo sts-protemplate` and follow prompts

## Future TODOs
* Choose what parts to include (e.g. only relics, or cards and events)
* Include Intellij (and other?) files so debugging is available without additional setup 
* Change repo and yeoman to be `sts-protemplate`. Current one is redundant.
