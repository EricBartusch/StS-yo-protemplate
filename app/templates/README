This is an example character template for the more experienced Slay the Spire modder.
It contains the basics of an empty character, as well as:
- Improved X cost action framework (Alchyr)
- General action use wizard for any effects (GK + my own stuff)
- Lambda power support (mine)
- Automatic ability to apply TempPowers. Make any power a Flex! (me)
- AbstractRelic, Power and Card with improved image loading and other shortcuts (alchyr + mine)
- AbstractCard comes with secondary variable and secondary damage (me + Kio)
- Automatic card recoloring (me + Mayhem)
- Hopefully more! Let me know if there's something you'd want added!!

Setup guide:
1. Clone the project with Github, preferably downloading with Github Desktop to make it so IntelliJ integration is easy!
2. Go into your pom.xml, and change the description
3. In the modded character file, go to the Enums section at the bottom and change the PlayerClass and CardColor enums. They're also annotated with TODOs.
4. Update this file!
